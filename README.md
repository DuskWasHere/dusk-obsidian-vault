## Working on it **(up in about 2 days)**
- [ ] light version of the vault (only include plugins used for the core functionalities)
- [ ] mobile display compatibility
- [ ] better documentation

## Vault Structure
This vault fuses **PARA** and **Zettelkasten** frameworks for a dynamic, scalable knowledge system.
- **HUB**: Central command with a homepage, map, and inbox for seamless navigation and task tracking.
- **PARA**: Action-focused—**Projects** for deadlines, **Areas** for ongoing pursuits, **Resources** for all reference materials, and **Archive** for completed work.
- **ZETA**: Idea-centric—**Permanent Notes** for lasting insights, **Literature** for research, and **Fleeting Notes** for quick ideas.
- **DAILY**: Organized reflections on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
- **STICKY**: Temporary notes for brainstorming.
- **SYSTEM**: Core vault setup, housing media, templates, and configurations.

Built for growth, this structure adapts as your knowledge and projects evolve!
