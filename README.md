• **Latest components and features** not available in this repository  
• **Real-time development updates** and implementation guides  
• **Technical support** for both legacy and current versions  
• **Direct participation** in shaping future development

## Development Status
The vault system has evolved significantly beyond this repository. Current development focuses on performance optimization and enhanced workflows, with continuous updates available exclusively through Discord.

**The documentation below references the legacy version only.**

## Legacy vs Current Version
**Legacy (this repo):** Full vault system, PARA + Zettelkasten, all-in-one approach  
**Current (Discord):** Modular components, faster performance, choose only what you need  

The philosophy evolved from "here's everything" to "build exactly what you want."

- [x] hotfix for area templates (area_family, area_note, area_note_sub)
- [x] hotfix for monthly note template

### Vault Structure
This vault fuses **PARA** and **Zettelkasten** frameworks for a dynamic, scalable knowledge system.

- **HUB**: Central command with a homepage, map, and inbox for seamless navigation and task tracking.
- **PARA**: Action-focused—**Projects** for deadlines, **Areas** for ongoing pursuits, **Resources** for all reference materials, and **Archive** for completed work.
- **ZETA**: Idea-centric—**Permanent Notes** for lasting insights, **Literature** for research, and **Fleeting Notes** for quick ideas.
- **DAILY**: Organized reflections on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
- **STICKY**: Temporary notes for brainstorming.
- **SYSTEM**: Core vault setup, housing media, templates, and configurations.

Built for growth, this structure adapts as your knowledge and projects evolve!
