## Highlight
I am working on a vault update to enhance performance and improve workflows. Looking to have it up before January 25, 2025.

## Recent Updates (November 16, 2024):
- [x] hotfix for area templates (area_family, area_note, area_note_sub)
- [x] hotfix for monthly note template
- [x] final version of documentation for vault concept map

Note: If you have an older zip file (the version with light integration) and you already have your files migrated, simply copy the files from the update folder and paste them into their respective locations. However, please note that your documentation will remain outdated.

## Vault Structure
This vault fuses **PARA** and **Zettelkasten** frameworks for a dynamic, scalable knowledge system.
- **HUB**: Central command with a homepage, map, and inbox for seamless navigation and task tracking.
- **PARA**: Action-focused—**Projects** for deadlines, **Areas** for ongoing pursuits, **Resources** for all reference materials, and **Archive** for completed work.
- **ZETA**: Idea-centric—**Permanent Notes** for lasting insights, **Literature** for research, and **Fleeting Notes** for quick ideas.
- **DAILY**: Organized reflections on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
- **STICKY**: Temporary notes for brainstorming.
- **SYSTEM**: Core vault setup, housing media, templates, and configurations.

Built for growth, this structure adapts as your knowledge and projects evolve!
## Vault Features

- Concept Inspiration and Reference can be found inside the vault.
